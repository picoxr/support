# PicoXR SDK Official Repository
Welcome to the official PicoXR DevSupport GitHub repository.
In this repository you will find demo projects created with the Pico SDK, as well as useful information and development resources.

## üí° Features
The Pico SDK provides access to a set of features that can be used for games and applications development in Unity, Unreal and Android. 

Unity 2019.4 LTS is the earliest Unity version supported by the Pico Unity Integration SDK. If you would like to use more features such as Vulkan, Unity 2020.3 LTS and Unity 2021.3 LTS are recommended.

For Unreal development, UE 4.25, 4.26 and 4.27 are supported.
| SDK Version | Supported platform |
